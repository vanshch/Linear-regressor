# A closed form Linear Regressor 
- Can handle nearly singular Gram matrix 
- Gives the most optimal result for any linear regression problem 


# Considerations
1. Should preferably be used for less then 1000 rows data as O(n^3) complexity 
2. Code has comments named '# dev st' and '# dev end' as for quick developer checks
